This is my attempt at creating a calculator application. Shows use of the math library. 
I know that my try/except blocks are a really clumsy solution. Anyone that knows how it can be done better, is welcome to help.

Update 29 September: I am now adding new files to this repository, with a pyside6 graphic user interface.
